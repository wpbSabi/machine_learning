# machine_learning
Models utilizing algorithms for prediction, classification, clustering, or association without being explicitly programmed for the method to predict the targets

# What is in the machine_learning repository and what are they? 

Currently there is one model in the repository: 
farmers_markets.ipynb

This model utilizes multiple forms of regression to analyze and predict how many farmers markets might be in each US county based on income and population statistics.


# Why/History

The question that the models attempt to provide insights towards is, "Is this market (county) oversaturated with farmers markets or would adding more farmers markets be feasible?"  Additonally, I am interested in finding data about how successful these farmers markets are, the number of vendors at each market, etc. Please reach out to me on twitter @tourofdata if you know where to find this data!  Otherwise, I'll search every so often.


## Want to know more or see a quick summary?

A PDF summary will be created soon, after some additional model enhancements.

# How do I run the code?

Utilize a jupyter notebook to open the ".ipynb" file.  There are more details inside the notebook about the formulation, assumptions, and future model enhancements planned.
